## The Multi-carrier Shipping API

purplship shipping API is powered by REST. Rather than dealing with non-standardized,
often poorly documented carrier webservices and arcane technologies such as SOAP. purplship
proposes a unified and intuitive REST API compatible for all supported carriers services.


## API References

purplship exposes a set of REST API resources. The full references are accessible at `/openapi/`
for the full description of the service APIs from your browser.
