# Reference

!!! caution
    **This documentation is a for legacy version of the purplship-server (up to 2021.7).**

    **Please visit [purplship.com/docs](https://purplship.com/docs) for the latest documentation.**

The purplship API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies,
returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the purplship API with carriers sandbox servers by setting the `test` flag to `True` when you configure your carrier connection.
The **carrier id** you specify in the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.

The purplship API differs for every instances as we release new versions and tailor functionality.
Check your local instance API reference to see docs customized to your version of the API.

## Authentication

The purplship API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the purplship Administration panel.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Use your API key by assigning it to client `API_KEY`. The client library will then automatically send this key in each request.

API requests without authentication will also fail.


=== "**Python**"

    ```python
    import purplship
    purplship.host = 'https://<server_address>'
    purplship.api_key = '<api_key>'
    ```

=== "**PHP**"

    ```php
    require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

    $purplship = new \purplship\purplship('<api_key>', 'https://<server_address>');
    ```

=== "**Node**"

    ```javascript
    import purplship from 'purplship';

    const purplship = new purplship('API_KEY', 'https://<server_address>');
    ```
    ```

=== "**Javascript**"

        apiKey: 'API_KEY', host: 'https://<server_address>'
    });

## Errors

purplship uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

!!! info "In general:"

    Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. <br/>
    Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided *(e.g., a required parameter was omitted)*.<br/>
    Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with purplship' servers.

| ---------------------------: |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                     200 - OK | Everything worked as expected.                                                                   |
|            400 - Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.                         |
|           401 - Unauthorized | No valid API key provided.                                                                       |
