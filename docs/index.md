## What's purplship server?

purplship server is a headless **shipping platform** for innovators who want to regain control over their logistics
processes and fulfilment automation.
The server is a self-hosted Multi-carrier Shipping API based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
and [purplship SDK](https://sdk.purplship.com).

You can use any programming language to send API requests to our growing network of
shipping carriers from your app.

## Features

- **Headless shipping API**: Power up your application with access to a network of carrier services
- **Multi-carrier**: Integrate purplship once and connect to multiple shipping carrier APIs
- **Shipping**: Connect carrier accounts, get live rates and purchase shipping labels
- **Tracking**: Create package tracker, get real time tracking status and provide a branded tracking page
- **Address Validation**: Validate shipping addresses using the Google Geocoding API
- **Shipping Web App**: Use a single dashboard to orchestrate your logistics operation.
- **Cloud**: Optimized for deployments using Docker

## Quick Start
